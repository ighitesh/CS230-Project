# About the contents of this folder
Inside the ChampSim master folder, a python script was used to generate run of varying CPU builds, tested on different traces.

The collected data, both new and old, is now used by the python script here to generate a csv file, containing average latencies for all cache levels.

This can then be used to generate graphs, some of which have been included as an example.

## THIS FOLDER IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CHAMPSIM IN ANY WAY
## IT JUST USES DATA COLLECTED FROM THERE TO MAKE IT EASILY PRESENTABLE
